<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `ODBbB`package has three core functions. Transposing the data table Block by block, Inversing and taking two different data tables or matrices and executing the product between their blocks. There are also some other functions that return to the user the Mean or the SD of a matrix block by block (even if we have a large data table).

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("ODBbB")
```
